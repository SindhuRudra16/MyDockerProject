kafka Consumer Pipeline - Readme

Overview

This Kafka consumer is designed to consume user login data from a Kafka topic, apply transformations, aggregations, and filtering, and then produce processed data into another Kafka topic. Additionally, it generates insights regarding platform usage, app version distribution, and peak login times.

Design Choices

Kafka Broker Configuration: The consumer connects to a Kafka broker at localhost:29092, listening to the user-login topic and publishing processed messages to the processed-user-login topic.

Message Validation: Ensures that required fields (user_id, app_version, device_type, timestamp) exist before processing the data.

Data Transformation: Converts the UNIX timestamp into a human-readable format for better interpretability.

Filtering Condition: The consumer filters only Android users with an app version greater than 3.0.

Aggregation:

Tracks the number of users per device type.

Tracks the number of users per app version.

Determines the peak login hour from processed messages.

Scalability:

Uses a Kafka-based messaging pipeline to ensure efficient data processing.

Supports real-time message streaming and batch processing.

Fault Tolerance:

Handles missing fields by skipping invalid messages.

Catches and logs processing errors without stopping execution.

Data Flow:

The consumer listens to the user-login topic for new messages.

Each message is validated to ensure it has the necessary fields.

If valid, the data undergoes transformations:

The timestamp is formatted to YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

Platform and app version usage are counted.

The message is filtered, allowing only Android users with an app version greater than 3.0.

If the message meets the criteria, it is sent to the processed-user-login topic.

After processing a defined number of messages (MAX_MESSAGES = 10), the consumer stops and prints insights about platform usage and peak login hours.

Ensuring Efficiency and Scalability

Batch Processing: The consumer processes messages in a streaming manner but limits processing to MAX_MESSAGES for efficiency.

Parallel Consumption: Multiple consumer instances can be deployed in a consumer group to distribute load and handle high-throughput streams.

Asynchronous Processing: Kafka’s producer sends messages asynchronously to ensure minimal processing delays.

Optimized Data Structures: Using Python’s defaultdict and list for efficient data aggregation and insights computation.

Missing Field Handling: Messages missing required fields are logged and skipped, preventing pipeline failures.

Exception Handling: Try-except blocks ensure that invalid messages (e.g., with incorrect timestamps) do not crash the pipeline.

Graceful Shutdown: The consumer closes both producer and consumer connections after execution to release resources.

Running the Consumer

Ensure Kafka is running and topics are created before executing:

python consumer.py

Modify MAX_MESSAGES as needed for longer processing durations.

Future Enhancements

Implement database storage for aggregated metrics.

Introduce more advanced insights, such as user retention and session duration tracking.

Deploy in a distributed environment using Kubernetes for high availability.
